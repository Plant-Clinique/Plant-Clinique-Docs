# Introduction
Our application, Plant-Clinique, is a web-based application with the main goal of plant health. Essentially, it is a health checkup and care app for your plants. It will be able to remind you to water your plants as the Planta app does, but, in addition, it also has a chat functionality very similar to the Ada app where you can describe different conditions of your plant (leaf color, soil texture, how the blossoms look, how much fun it's getting), and the app will give you suggestions for how to improve the plant's health (recommend products or just actions you can take to improve your plant's condition). Users will also be able to post questions to a forum with tags (to group them) and those posts will have replies. Many people have let way too many plants die just because they didn't know what to do to keep them alive and didn't have anyone to ask, this app will solve that problem.
