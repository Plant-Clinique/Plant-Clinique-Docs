# Conclusion

Reflecting upon our lessons learned, the first and foremost thing to conclude on is that Murphy’s Law is very much a real thing. We saw our crucial Trefle APIs falling apart, we’re able to come together, quickly pivot, and circumvent the problem. We felt that this project was very much an adventure. We noticed how essential communication was for anything to come to fruition. We also saw how in reality proper coding techniques are necessary for a project to proceed because when one person had sloppy code, others had to sift through to find out how code worked.

On the brighter side, in just one semester we were able to achieve a great deal. We learned the language, the framework, did the homework, and created a really helpful app to facilitate the flow of information about plants and make sure that people keep their plants healthy. Our mission to address the problem of inexperienced people letting their plants die while also providing general information for all plant enthusiasts. In the end, we were proud of our app with an awesome UI and a multitude of features while agreeing more features and improvements can be added.

Hopefully, with Plant Clinique released, we can help keep plants healthy and alive, help spread plant information and encourage more plant enthusiasts
