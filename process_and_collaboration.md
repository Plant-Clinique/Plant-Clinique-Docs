# Process and Collaboration

All of our pages were first on paper, and then discussed at length in multiple meetings, before moving to production. We would meet Tuesday and Thursday for a half hour to show updates and ask questions, and then do a more in depth discussion during our Saturday hour long meetings. Initially, Eric and Prabu led different views for our backend team (Osamah and Roman). As the project progressed, Prabu desired to work on both frontend and backend development, so he began working on backend and Eric did the UI. 

For our week to week development, we would do a choice system, jumping at and taking tickets based on interest. Because we were constantly using and adding to Trello, we never ran out of things to do, and we made sure that we all had the same amount of work to do per week. We also saw that because all of our meetups were virtual, coupled with us all taking full close loads, if there is not communication, there is no project. Check-ins and slacking were the lifeblood of progress. 

Our collaboration relied heavily on the communication we used. We met or discussed using: 

*   Communications: Slack, Zoom, Topia, Google Meet
*   Project managements: [Trello](https://trello.com/b/z8943iMn/team1)
*   Code/file share: Github, Google Drive
*   App hosting: Heroku
*   Interface, design: Figma, Lucid Chart
*   General Discussion: Jamboard, Docs
