# Product Purpose

Our app was made to facilitate the flow of information for plant care, to allow extensive Q&A about your plants with the goal of saving more plants. This addresses the problem of inexperienced people having their plants die while also providing general information for all people who keep plants. This will also show where to get plants while also reminding you to keep them alive through reminders. Finally, the posts page will have a forum for plant talk and questions with replies and conversations.
